## Updated Portfolio in React

Deployed site: https://maddison-wells.netlify.app/

## Activity Log

### Thursday 2nd May

Added the illustration to the home and worked on responsiviness

### Wednesday 1st May

Added a clipboard function so that my email address on the contacts page would be added to the users clipboard for ease of use. I personally don't like when you click on an email and it redirects you to a blank email.

Also started to work on responsiveness of the app beacuse I am using a library for the work component, I will need to re-read the docs to make sure the media query works properly.

I am also just finalising an illustration of myself for the home page, then I can update my resume with the new link.

### Tuesday 30th April

Decided to redo my portfolio, firstly, as it was built with HTML and JS, so feel that using react will be a more seamless approach. Also need to update my projects
